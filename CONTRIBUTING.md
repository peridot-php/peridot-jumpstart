# Contributing

We dig open source. If you want to help out, we would certainly welcome
contributions large or small.

## Reporting Bugs

Issues can be reported on the [issue tracker]. When reporting, examples that
allow contributors to reproduce the issue are always appreciated. Even better,
include failing test.

## Requesting Features

We would love to hear ideas for making Peridot better. Feel free to create a
"feature" issue on the [issue tracker].

If you see an existing feature request that you like, please chime in to the
conversation so other contributors can see how many people are interested in a
particular feature.

## Contributing code

We stick to [PSR-2] coding standards. To check for code style issues, first make
sure your changes are staged, then run `make lint`.
